# IOTSmokeDetector
Smoke Detectors are very useful in detecting smoke or fire in buildings, and so are the important safety parameters. 

So I have build a Smoke Detector Circuit which not only sense the smoke in the air but also reads and displays the level of Smoke in the Air in PPM (parts per million). 

This circuit triggers the Buzzer when Smoke level becomes higher than 100 ppm, increasing rapidity and changing the patter of the beeper the more particle it gets. 

This threshold value can be changed in the Code according to the requirement.
